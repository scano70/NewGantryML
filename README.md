# NewGantryML

The gantry machine has a microscopic camera fitted into it that can move around the table and take pictures. The goal with this project is to train an algorithm to recognize modules placed on the table so it can align itself on top and be able to pick it up without human intervention.

## Installation

You can either use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or any other python text editor. If you choose to use Anaconda, it's good practice to create a new environment for this project. Open up anaconda terminal and enter this:

`conda create --name myenv`

You can change "myenv" to any environment name you want. Next, you need to activate the environment:

`conda activate myenv`

After the packages is activated, you will need to install a few packages. Here's the list of packages you'll need and how to install them using conda:

-NumPy (Array processing for numbers, strings, records, and objects)
`conda install -c anaconda numpy`

-Pandas (High-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools)
`conda install pandas`

-TensorFlow (Machine learning library)
`conda install tensorflow-gpu`





`pip install numpy`
